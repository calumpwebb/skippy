    "description": "A massive, heavily armored ARC unit, built around a terrifying, fully automatic minigun. It rarely moves without air support overhead, which helps it pin down and suppress Raider movement. Listen for its loud, distinct screech—that's your warning before it unleashes a three-second hail of bullets toward the last known enemy position.",

    "description": "The Bombardier is an armored ARC that functions as heavy, mobile artillery. Its movement is slow and loud. Armed with a multi-rocket launcher, it unleashes devastating, long-range barrages that can obliterate your entire squad. Do not engage this unit. If you hear its grinding approach, silence your movement and escape the area immediately, as its attention is a death sentence.",

    "description": "This is a medium-class drone, easily recognizable by the pair of armored rotors mounted prominently on its front. It rarely operates alone, preferring to patrol the skies alongside a swarm of Wasps or to act as an aerial shield for a larger, ground-based ARC. Its main attack is a focused, high-speed projectile. Watch for the brief, one-second pulse of a red aiming laser—that's your warning before it fires a specialized stun round designed to shred Raider shields and tear through light armor almost instantly.",

Its heavy armor gives it a hulking, near-indestructible presence on the battlefield, but don't mistake its bulk for sluggishness. This mechanized spider possesses an unnerving, gravity-defying ability to leap vast distances. Reports confirm it has been seen clearing impossible gaps, even bounding effortlessly to the summit of a Spaceport tower. It's a vertical threat you can't simply hide from.",
