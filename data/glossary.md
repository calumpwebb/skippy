# ARC Raiders: Introduction & Glossary

## Introduction to ARC Raiders

ARC Raiders is a free-to-play multiplayer extraction adventure developed by Embark Studios, set in a lethal future Earth ravaged by a mysterious mechanized threat known as ARC. Released in October 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, the game thrusts players into the role of Raiders - scavengers risking their lives on the surface to secure resources and survive in a desolate world.

### The World

Earth is no longer ours. The skies, once a symbol of freedom, now serve as conduits for destruction, raining down mysterious and unforgiving enemies known as ARC (Automated Reconnaissance & Combat machines). As a Raider, you navigate stunning yet dangerous landscapes—from forgotten urban sprawls to desolate coastlines—each holding secrets of the past and the key to humanity's future.

Players operate from Speranza, an underground city that serves as humanity's last bastion of hope. From here, Raiders venture "Topside" to the surface world to scavenge valuable resources, complete quests, and fight against the overwhelming ARC threat.

### Core Gameplay

ARC Raiders combines elements of extraction shooters with cooperative PvE and PvPvE combat. Players gear up in Speranza, venture Topside to complete objectives and gather loot, then extract back to safety. The game emphasizes risk-versus-reward gameplay where every decision carries consequences. Fail to extract, and you lose everything you gathered on that run.

**Spawning System:** Players spawn in their underground apartment in Speranza between raids, where they can access storage, customize loadouts, visit traders, and accept quests. From there, they take transport tubes to launch onto the surface maps via dropships or insertion points.

**Match/Raid End:** Each Topside mission has a 30-minute time limit. Players must reach extraction points and call for extraction before time runs out. Successfully extracting with loot allows progression, while failing to extract results in losing all items gathered during that raid. Players can also be eliminated by ARC machines or hostile Raiders, forcing them back to Speranza empty-handed.

The game supports up to three-player squads, encouraging teamwork and strategic coordination to overcome both ARC machines and potentially hostile Raiders who might prey on others for their valuable loot.

## Comprehensive Glossary

### Core Locations & Concepts

**Topside** - The general term for all playable surface maps where Raiders spend most of their time scavenging for loot and completing objectives. Topside is extremely dangerous, populated by ARC machines and potentially hostile Raiders.

**Speranza** - The underground home base and last city of humanity. Raiders return here to rest, gear up, trade, and prepare for their next Topside expedition. It serves as the social hub and safe zone.

**Extraction** - The process of returning safely from Topside to Speranza with your collected loot. Successfully extracting is crucial - fail to extract and you lose everything gathered during that run.

**PvPvE** - Player versus Player versus Environment gameplay. Raiders must contend with both ARC machines (PvE) and potentially hostile other Raiders (PvP) while on Topside missions.

### ARC Enemy Types

#### Low Threat ARCs

- **Snitch** - Unarmed reconnaissance drone that scans ground for exposed raiders and calls in other ARC enemies for backup if it detects threats. Can be shot down with long-range weapons.
- **Surveyor** - Rare, fast-moving ARC that rolls around like Pops but much quicker. Occasionally stops to fire bright blue beam into air. Rewards valuable crafting materials if caught.
- **Tick** - Small ARC that clings to walls and ceilings inside buildings, particularly dark areas. Can be destroyed easily but may ambush unsuspecting Raiders.

#### Moderate Threat ARCs

- **Pop** - Small, unarmored rolling ARC that vents short-range flame jets when Raiders get close. Weaker cousin to the Fireball.
- **Turret** - Small automated sentry mounted on walls/ceilings, typically defending key areas in narrow corridors with light weapons.
- **Wasp** - Compact aerial scout drone that harasses Raiders with quick light ammo bursts. Flashes red aiming laser before firing. Hunts in small groups.

#### High Threat ARCs

- **Fireball** - Armored rolling incendiary unit, upgraded from Pop. Engulfs areas with frontal flamethrower. Core only vulnerable during attack.
- **Hornet** - Medium-sized drone with two armored front rotors. Fires electrified stun rounds that paralyze Raiders and shred shields. Semi-plated chassis resists light fire.
- **Sentinel** - Long-range heavy-hitting upgrade to turrets, found atop rooftops and cliffs. Snipes hostiles but can't take punishment - unarmored tracking mechanism is its weakness.
- **Shredder** - Brutal close-quarters ARC found in Stella Montis. Rushes Raiders down and blankets tight spaces with shrapnel blasts.
- **Spotter** - High-priority support ARC that paints targets for Bombardiers. Doesn't attack directly but enables extreme-range artillery strikes. Light armor but respawns quickly.

#### Critical Threat ARCs

- **Bastion** - Slow, hulking crab-like ARC armed with powerful minigun. Frontal 'face' heavily armored - must flank to damage rear mechanisms and joints. Often supported by aerial ARCs.
- **Bombardier** - Towering long-range artillery ARC that rains mortar fire from distance using Spotter drones. Target yellow kneecaps and rear cylinder to cripple.
- **Leaper** - Aggressive walker ARC, fast and nimble capable of leaping long distances. Actively hunts Raiders, using weight to smash and release stunning energy shockwaves. 'Eye' and joints are weak spots.
- **Rocketeer** - Flying, heavily-armored rocket platform with huge range causing area denial. Slow movement is its only weakness - engines are vulnerable but hard to hit.

#### Extreme Threat ARCs

- **Queen** - The pinnacle of ARC machines, unmatched in weapons and armor. Typically guards harvesters. Possesses devastating mortars, high-powered laser, EMP pulses, and six crushing legs. Requires coordinated team with plenty of ammo and meds.
- **Matriarch** - Colossal ARC, largest encountered, dwarfing even the Queen. Saturates battlefield with explosive rockets and gas mortars. Can deploy heavy energy shields and calls in supporting ARCs including Fireballs, Wasps, Leapers, Bastions, Bombardiers, and Rocketeers.

### Maps

**Dam Battlegrounds** - The first available map featuring the Alcantara Power Plant. Offers diverse terrain from open areas to vertical zones and close-quarters sections. Always available with medium difficulty - ideal for learning game mechanics.

**Buried City** - A pre-collapse urban zone now covered in sand dunes in an arid wasteland. Contains rare pre-war technology and is unlocked after 8 rounds.

**Spaceport** - The third map, Acerra Spaceport - a high-tech facility where Exodus shuttles once launched. High-risk, high-reward environment with advanced loot but increased danger.

**The Blue Gate** - The fourth map located in mountainous terrain, once a symbol of connection. Features significantly increased ARC presence and unlocks after 18 rounds.

**Stella Montis** - A map featuring close-quarters environments and multi-level structures requiring awareness of vertical advantages.

### Gameplay Mechanics

**Component Destruction** - The principle of targeting specific weak points on ARC machines rather than just general damage. Critical for efficiently defeating heavily armored enemies.

**Quests** - Objectives given by NPCs in Speranza that send Raiders to specific locations Topside with particular goals, often requiring exploration across multiple maps.

**Loot** - Valuable items and resources gathered Topside that can be used for crafting, trading, or improving gear. Must be successfully extracted to be retained.

**Extraction Points** - Designated locations on each map where Raiders can call for extraction back to Speranza.

### Raiders & Factions

**Raider** - The player character, a scavenger and fighter operating from Speranza to gather resources and survive the ARC threat.

**Apollo** - An NPC quest giver in Speranza who provides missions to find survivors and gather intelligence.

### Weapons & Combat

**Light Weapons** - Category of weapons effective against unarmored or lightly armored ARC types like Wasps, Pops, and Turrets.

**Heavy Weapons** - Required for effectively damaging heavily armored ARC types like Bastions, Bombardiers, and Queens.

**Area of Denial** - Tactical concept where weapons or abilities (like Rocketeer's rockets) prevent enemy movement through specific areas.

### Technical Terms

**ARC** - Automated Reconnaissance & Combat machines. The mysterious mechanized threat that has overwhelmed Earth and serves as the primary enemy faction.

**MetaForge** - The API system that provides game data and information about ARC Raiders (referenced in the Skippy project context).

**Extraction Shooter** - Game genre focused on entering dangerous areas, gathering loot, and successfully extracting while managing risk versus reward.
